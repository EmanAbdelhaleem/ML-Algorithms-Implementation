# 1. Color Extraction using K-Means

This notebook demonstrates how to extract the **dominant colors** from an image using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**. The notebook loads an image, applies clustering on its pixels, and displays the most important colors found.

## Features

* Loads an input image
* Applies **K-Means** clustering on pixel values
* Extracts dominant colors
* Visualizes the results
* Very easy to modify for any image



If you want, I can also create a more advanced README with examples, images, or explanations of K-Means.
